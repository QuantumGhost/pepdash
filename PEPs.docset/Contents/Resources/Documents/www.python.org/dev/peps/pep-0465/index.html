     In numerical code, there are two important operations which compete
for use of Python's
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      *
     </tt>
     operator: elementwise multiplication, and
matrix multiplication.  In the nearly twenty years since the Numeric
library was first proposed, there have been many attempts to resolve
this tension
     <a class="footnote-reference" href="#hugunin" id="id1">
      [13]
     </a>
     ; none have been really satisfactory.
Currently, most numerical Python code uses
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      *
     </tt>
     for elementwise
multiplication, and function/method syntax for matrix multiplication;
however, this leads to ugly and unreadable code in common
circumstances.  The problem is bad enough that significant amounts of
code continue to use the opposite convention (which has the virtue of
producing ugly and unreadable code in
     <em>
      different
     </em>
     circumstances), and
this API fragmentation across codebases then creates yet more
problems.  There does not seem to be any
     <em>
      good
     </em>
     solution to the
problem of designing a numerical API within current Python syntax --
only a landscape of options that are bad in different ways.  The
minimal change to Python syntax which is sufficient to resolve these
problems is the addition of a single new infix operator for matrix
multiplication.
    </p>
    <p>
     Matrix multiplication has a singular combination of features which
distinguish it from other binary operations, which together provide a
uniquely compelling case for the addition of a dedicated infix
operator:
    </p>
    <ul class="simple">
     <li>
      Just as for the existing numerical operators, there exists a vast
body of prior art supporting the use of infix notation for matrix
multiplication across all fields of mathematics, science, and
engineering;
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       @
      </tt>
      harmoniously fills a hole in Python's existing
operator system.
     </li>
     <li>
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       @

     </li>
     <li>
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       @
      </tt>
      provides a smoother onramp for less experienced users, who are
particularly harmed by hard-to-read code and API fragmentation.
     </li>
     <li>
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       @
      </tt>
      benefits a substantial and growing portion of the Python user
community.
     </li>
     <li>
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       @
      </tt>
      will be used frequently -- in fact, evidence suggests it may
be used more frequently than
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       //

      or the bitwise operators.

    <p>
     When we crunch numbers on a computer, we usually have lots and lots of
numbers to deal with.  Trying to deal with them one at a time is
cumbersome and slow -- especially when using an interpreted language.
Instead, we want the ability to write down simple operations that
apply to large collections of numbers all at once.  The
     <em>
      n-dimensional
array
     </em>
     is the basic object that all popular numeric computing
environments use to make this possible.  Python has several libraries
that provide such arrays, with numpy being at present the most
prominent.
    </p>
    <p>
     When working with n-dimensional arrays, there are two different ways
we might want to define multiplication.  One is elementwise
multiplication:
    </p>
    <pre class="literal-block">
[[1, 2],     [[11, 12],     [[1 * 11, 2 * 12],
 [3, 4]]  x   [13, 14]]  =   [3 * 13, 4 * 14]]
</pre>
    <p>
     and the other is
     <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication">
      matrix multiplication
     </a>
     <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id19" id="id20">
      [19]
     </a>
     :
    </p>
    <pre class="literal-block">
[[1, 2],     [[11, 12],     [[1 * 11 + 2 * 13, 1 * 12 + 2 * 14],
 [3, 4]]  x   [13, 14]]  =   [3 * 11 + 4 * 13, 3 * 12 + 4 * 14]]
</pre>
    <p>
     Elementwise multiplication is useful because it lets us easily and
quickly perform many multiplications on a large collection of values,
without writing a slow and cumbersome
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      for
     </tt>
     loop.  And this works as
part of a very general schema: when using the array objects provided
by numpy or other numerical libraries, all Python operators work
elementwise on arrays of all dimensionalities.  The result is that one
can write functions using straightforward code like
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      a * b + c / d
     </tt>
     ,
treating the variables as if they were simple values, but then
immediately use this function to efficiently perform this calculation
on large collections of values, while keeping them organized using
whatever arbitrarily complex array layout works best for the problem
at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Matrix multiplication is more of a special case.  It's only defined on
2d arrays (also known as "matrices"), and multiplication is the only
operation that has an important "matrix" version -- "matrix addition"
is the same as elementwise addition; there is no such thing as "matrix
bitwise-or" or "matrix floordiv"; "matrix division" and "matrix
to-the-power-of" can be defined but are not very useful, etc.
However, matrix multiplication is still used very heavily across all
numerical application areas; mathematically, it's one of the most
fundamental operations there is.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because Python syntax currently allows for only a single
multiplication operator
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      *
     </tt>
     , libraries providing array-like objects
must decide: either use
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      *
     </tt>
     for elementwise multiplication, or use
     <tt class="docutils literal">

     for matrix multiplication.  And, unfortunately, it turns out
that when doing general-purpose number crunching, both operations are
used frequently, and there are major advantages to using infix rather
than function call syntax in both cases.  Thus it is not at all clear
which convention is optimal, or even acceptable; often it varies on a
case-by-case basis.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nonetheless, network effects mean that it is very important that we
pick
     <em>
      just one
     </em>
     convention.  In numpy, for example, it is technically
possible to switch between the conventions, because numpy provides two
different types with different
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      __mul__
     </tt>
     methods.  For
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      numpy.ndarray
     </tt>
     objects,
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      *
     </tt>
     performs elementwise multiplication,
and matrix multiplication must use a function call (
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      numpy.dot
     </tt>
     ).
For
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      numpy.matrix
     </tt>
     objects,
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      *
     </tt>
     performs matrix multiplication,
and elementwise multiplication requires function syntax.  Writing code
using
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      numpy.ndarray
     </tt>
     works fine.  Writing code using
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      numpy.matrix
     </tt>
     also works fine.  But trouble begins as soon as we
try to integrate these two pieces of code together.  Code that expects
an
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      ndarray
     </tt>
     and gets a
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      matrix
     </tt>
     , or vice-versa, may crash or
return incorrect results.  Keeping track of which functions expect
which types as inputs, and return which types as outputs, and then
converting back and forth all the time, is incredibly cumbersome and
impossible to get right at any scale.  Functions that defensively try
to handle both types as input and DTRT, find themselves floundering
into a swamp of
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      isinstance
     </tt>
     and
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      if
     </tt>
     statements.

     split

     </tt>
     and
     <tt class="docutils literal">

     into
two types:
     <tt class="docutils literal">

     , whose
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      __div__
     </tt>
     implemented true
division.  This, in a more limited way, is the situation that Python
number-crunchers currently find themselves in.
    </p>
    <p>
     In practice, the vast majority of projects have settled on the
convention of using
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      *
     </tt>
     for elementwise multiplication, and function
call syntax for matrix multiplication (e.g., using
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      numpy.ndarray
     </tt>
     instead of
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      numpy.matrix
     </tt>
     ).  This reduces the problems caused by API
fragmentation, but it doesn't eliminate them.  The strong desire to
use infix notation for matrix multiplication has caused a number of
specialized array libraries to continue to use the opposing convention
(e.g., scipy.sparse, pyoperators, pyviennacl) despite the problems
this causes, and
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      numpy.matrix
     </tt>
     itself still gets used in
introductory programming courses, often appears in StackOverflow
answers, and so forth.  Well-written libraries thus must continue to
be prepared to deal with both types of objects, and, of course, are
also stuck using unpleasant funcall syntax for matrix multiplication.
After nearly two decades of trying, the numerical community has still
not found any way to resolve these problems within the constraints of
current Python syntax (see
     <a class="reference internal" href="#rejected-alternatives-to-adding-a-new-operator">
      Rejected alternatives to adding a new
operator
     </a>
     below).
    </p>
    <p>
     This PEP proposes the minimum effective change to Python syntax that
will allow us to drain this swamp.  It splits
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      *
     </tt>
     into two
operators, just as was done for
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      /
     </tt>
     :
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      *
     </tt>
     for elementwise
multiplication, and
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     for matrix multiplication.  (Why not the
reverse?  Because this way is compatible with the existing consensus,
and because it gives us a consistent rule that all the built-in
numeric operators also apply in an elementwise manner to arrays; the
reverse convention would lead to more special cases.)
    </p>
    <p>
     So that's why matrix multiplication doesn't and can't just use
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      *
     </tt>
     .
Now, in the the rest of this section, we'll explain why it nonetheless
meets the high bar for adding a new operator.

      Why should matrix multiplication be infix?
     </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
     Right now, most numerical code in Python uses syntax like
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      numpy.dot(a, b)
     </tt>
     or
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      a.dot(b)
     </tt>
     to perform matrix multiplication.
This obviously works, so why do people make such a fuss about it, even
to the point of creating API fragmentation and compatibility swamps?
    </p>
    <p>
     Matrix multiplication shares two features with ordinary arithmetic
operations like addition and multiplication on numbers: (a) it is used
very heavily in numerical programs -- often multiple times per line of
code -- and (b) it has an ancient and universally adopted tradition of
being written using infix syntax.  This is because, for typical
formulas, this notation is dramatically more readable than any
function call syntax.  Here's an example to demonstrate:
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the most useful tools for testing a statistical hypothesis is
the linear hypothesis test for OLS regression models.  It doesn't
really matter what all those words I just said mean; if we find
ourselves having to implement this thing, what we'll do is look up
some textbook or paper on it, and encounter many mathematical formulas
that look like:
    </p>
    <div class="formula">
     <i>
      S
     </i>
     = (
     <i>
      H

     <i>
      β
     </i>
     −
     <i>
      r
     </i>
     )
     <sup>
      <i>
       T
      </i>
     </sup>
     (
     <i>
      H
     </i>
     <i>
      V
     </i>
     <i>
      H
     </i>
     <sup>
      <i>
       T
      </i>
     </sup>
     )
     <sup>
      − 1
     </sup>
     (
     <i>
      H
     </i>
     <i>
      β
     </i>
     −
     <i>
      r
     </i>
     )
    </div>
    <p>
     Here the various variables are all vectors or matrices (details for
the curious:
     <a class="footnote-reference" href="#lht" id="id2">

     </a>
     ).
    </p>
    <p>
     Now we need to write code to perform this calculation. In current
numpy, matrix multiplication can be performed using either the
function or method call syntax. Neither provides a particularly
readable translation of the formula:
    </p>
    <pre class="literal-block">
import numpy as np
from numpy.linalg import inv, solve

# Using dot function:
S = np.dot((np.dot(H, beta) - r).T,
           np.dot(inv(np.dot(np.dot(H, V), H.T)), np.dot(H, beta) - r))

# Using dot method:
S = (H.dot(beta) - r).T.dot(inv(H.dot(V).dot(H.T))).dot(H.dot(beta) - r)
</pre>
    <p>
     With the
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     operator, the direct translation of the above formula
becomes:
    </p>
    <pre class="literal-block">
S = (H @ beta - r).T @ inv(H @ V @ H.T) @ (H @ beta - r)
</pre>
    <p>
     Notice that there is now a transparent, 1-to-1 mapping between the
symbols in the original formula and the code that implements it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, an experienced programmer will probably notice that this is
not the best way to compute this expression.  The repeated computation
of
     <span class="formula">
      <i>
       H
      </i>
      <i>
       β
      </i>
      −
      <i>
       r
      </i>
     </span>
     should perhaps be factored out; and,
expressions of the form
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      dot(inv(A), B)
     </tt>
     should almost always be
replaced by the more numerically stable
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      solve(A, B)
     </tt>
     .  When using
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     , performing these two refactorings gives us:
    </p>
    <pre class="literal-block">
# Version 1 (as above)
S = (H @ beta - r).T @ inv(H @ V @ H.T) @ (H @ beta - r)

# Version 2
trans_coef = H @ beta - r
S = trans_coef.T @ inv(H @ V @ H.T) @ trans_coef

# Version 3
S = trans_coef.T @ solve(H @ V @ H.T, trans_coef)
</pre>
    <p>
     Notice that when comparing between each pair of steps, it's very easy
to see exactly what was changed.  If we apply the equivalent
transformations to the code using the .dot method, then the changes
are much harder to read out or verify for correctness:
    </p>
    <pre class="literal-block">
# Version 1 (as above)
S = (H.dot(beta) - r).T.dot(inv(H.dot(V).dot(H.T))).dot(H.dot(beta) - r)

# Version 2
trans_coef = H.dot(beta) - r
S = trans_coef.T.dot(inv(H.dot(V).dot(H.T))).dot(trans_coef)

# Version 3
S = trans_coef.T.dot(solve(H.dot(V).dot(H.T)), trans_coef)
</pre>
    <p>
     Readability counts!  The statements using
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     are shorter, contain
more whitespace, can be directly and easily compared both to each
other and to the textbook formula, and contain only meaningful
parentheses.  This last point is particularly important for
readability: when using function-call syntax, the required parentheses
on every operation create visual clutter that makes it very difficult
to parse out the overall structure of the formula by eye, even for a
relatively simple formula like this one.  Eyes are terrible at parsing
non-regular languages.  I made and caught many errors while trying to
write out the 'dot' formulas above.  I know they still contain at
least one error, maybe more.  (Exercise: find it.  Or them.)  The
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     examples, by contrast, are not only correct, they're obviously
correct at a glance.
    </p>
    <p>
     If we are even more sophisticated programmers, and writing code that
we expect to be reused, then considerations of speed or numerical
accuracy might lead us to prefer some particular order of evaluation.
Because
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     makes it possible to omit irrelevant parentheses, we can
be certain that if we
     <em>
      do
     </em>
     write something like
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      (H @ V) @ H.T
     </tt>
     ,
then our readers will know that the parentheses must have been added
intentionally to accomplish some meaningful purpose.  In the
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      dot
     </tt>
     examples, it's impossible to know which nesting decisions are
important, and which are arbitrary.
    </p>
    <p>
     Infix
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     dramatically improves matrix code usability at all stages
of programmer interaction.

     A large proportion of scientific code is written by people who are
experts in their domain, but are not experts in programming.  And
there are many university courses run each year with titles like "Data
analysis for social scientists" which assume no programming
background, and teach some combination of mathematical techniques,
introduction to programming, and the use of programming to implement
these mathematical techniques, all within a 10-15 week period.  These
courses are more and more often being taught in Python rather than
special-purpose languages like R or Matlab.
    </p>
    <p>
     For these kinds of users, whose programming knowledge is fragile, the
existence of a transparent mapping between formulas and code often
means the difference between succeeding and failing to write that code
at all.  This is so important that such classes often use the
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      numpy.matrix
     </tt>
     type which defines
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      *
     </tt>
     to mean matrix
multiplication, even though this type is buggy and heavily
disrecommended by the rest of the numpy community for the
fragmentation that it causes.  This pedagogical use case is, in fact,
the
     <em>
      only
     </em>
     reason
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      numpy.matrix

     remains a supported part of numpy.
Adding
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @

     will benefit both beginning and advanced users with
better syntax; and furthermore, it will allow both groups to
standardize on the same notation from the start, providing a smoother
on-ramp to expertise.

     The world is full of continuous data, and computers are increasingly
called upon to work with it in sophisticated ways.  Arrays are the
lingua franca of finance, machine learning, 3d graphics, computer
vision, robotics, operations research, econometrics, meteorology,
computational linguistics, recommendation systems, neuroscience,
astronomy, bioinformatics (including genetics, cancer research, drug
discovery, etc.), physics engines, quantum mechanics, geophysics,
network analysis, and many other application areas.  In most or all of
these areas, Python is rapidly becoming a dominant player, in large
part because of its ability to elegantly mix traditional discrete data
structures (hash tables, strings, etc.) on an equal footing with
modern numerical data types and algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
     We all live in our own little sub-communities, so some Python users
may be surprised to realize the sheer extent to which Python is used
for number crunching -- especially since much of this particular
sub-community's activity occurs outside of traditional Python/FOSS
channels.  So, to give some rough idea of just how many numerical
Python programmers are actually out there, here are two numbers: In
2013, there were 7 international conferences organized specifically on
numerical Python
     <a class="footnote-reference" href="#scipy-conf" id="id3">

     </a>
     <a class="footnote-reference" href="#pydata-conf" id="id4">
      [4]
     </a>
     .  At PyCon 2014, ~20%
of the tutorials appear to involve the use of matrices

    </p>
    <p>
     To quantify this further, we used Github's "search" function to look
at what modules are actually imported across a wide range of
real-world code (i.e., all the code on Github).  We checked for
imports of several popular stdlib modules, a variety of numerically
oriented modules, and various other extremely high-profile modules
like django and lxml (the latter of which is the #1 most downloaded
package on PyPI).  Starred lines indicate packages which export array-

handle a more-specialized arithmetic operation: the floor division

     We've seen that
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     makes matrix formulas dramatically easier to
work with for both experts and non-experts, that matrix formulas
appear in many important applications, and that numerical libraries
like numpy are used by a substantial proportion of Python's user base.
But numerical libraries aren't just about matrix formulas, and being
important doesn't necessarily mean taking up a lot of code: if matrix
formulas only occured in one or two places in the average
numerically-oriented project, then it still wouldn't be worth adding a
new operator.  So how common is matrix multiplication, really?

    <p>
     When the going gets tough, the tough get empirical.  To get a rough
estimate of how useful the

     operator will be, the table below
shows the rate at which different Python operators are actually used
in the stdlib, and also in two high-profile numerical packages -- the
scikit-learn machine learning library, and the nipy neuroimaging
library -- normalized by source lines of code (SLOC).  Rows are sorted
by the 'combined' column, which pools all three code bases together.
The combined column is thus strongly weighted towards the stdlib,
which is much larger than both projects put together (stdlib: 411575
SLOC, scikit-learn: 50924 SLOC, nipy: 37078 SLOC).

     These two numerical packages alone contain ~780 uses of matrix
multiplication.  Within these packages, matrix multiplication is used
more heavily than most comparison operators (
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      &lt;
     </tt>
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      !=
     </tt>
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      &lt;=
     </tt>
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      &gt;=
     </tt>
     ).  Even when we dilute these counts by including the stdlib
into our comparisons, matrix multiplication is still used more often
in total than any of the bitwise operators, and 2x as often as
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      //
     </tt>
     .
This is true even though the stdlib, which contains a fair amount of
integer arithmetic and no matrix operations, makes up more than 80% of
the combined code base.
    </p>
    <p>
     By coincidence, the numeric libraries make up approximately the same
proportion of the 'combined' codebase as numeric tutorials make up of
PyCon 2014's tutorial schedule, which suggests that the 'combined'
column may not be
     <em>
      wildly
     </em>
     unrepresentative of new Python code in
general.  While it's impossible to know for certain, from this data it
seems entirely possible that across all Python code currently being
written, matrix multiplication is already used more often than
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      //
     </tt>
     and the bitwise operations.

     It's certainly unusual (though extended slicing existed for some time

And this PEP provides the critical piece that will allow the Python

adding a numerical array type to the stdlib.

   <p>
    Currently, the only legal use of the
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     @

    token in Python code is at
statement beginning in decorators.  The new operators are both infix;
the one place they can never occur is at statement beginning.
Therefore, no existing code will be broken by the addition of these
operators, and there is no possible parsing ambiguity between
decorator-@ and the new operators.
   </p>
   <p>
    Another important kind of compatibility is the mental cost paid by
users to update their understanding of the Python language after this
change, particularly for users who do not work with matrices and thus
do not benefit.  Here again,

    This section is informative, rather than normative -- it documents the

    This section uses the numpy terminology for describing arbitrary
multidimensional arrays of data, because it is a superset of all other
commonly used models.  In this model, the
    <em>
     shape
    </em>
    of any array is
represented by a tuple of integers.  Because matrices are
two-dimensional, they have len(shape) == 2, while 1d vectors have
len(shape) == 1, and scalars have shape == (), i.e., they are "0
dimensional".  Any array contains prod(shape) total entries.  Notice
that
    <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_product">
     prod(()) == 1
    </a>
    <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id21" id="id22">
     [20]
    </a>
    (for the same reason that sum(()) == 0); scalars
are just an ordinary kind of array, not a special case.  Notice also
that we distinguish between a single scalar value (shape == (),
analogous to
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     1
    </tt>
    ), a vector containing only a single entry (shape ==
(1,), analogous to
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     [1]
    </tt>
    ), a matrix containing only a single entry
(shape == (1, 1), analogous to
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     [[1]]
    </tt>
    ), etc., so the dimensionality
of any array is always well-defined.  Other libraries with more
restricted representations (e.g., those that support 2d arrays only)
might implement only a subset of the functionality described here.

    <p>
     The recommended semantics for
     <tt class="docutils literal">

     for different inputs are:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p class="first">
       2d inputs are conventional matrices, and so the semantics are
obvious: we apply conventional matrix multiplication.  If we write
       <tt class="docutils literal">
        arr(2, 3)
       </tt>
       to represent an arbitrary 2x3 array, then
       <tt class="docutils literal">
        arr(2, 3)
@ arr(3, 4)

     <li>
      <p class="first">
       1d vector inputs are promoted to 2d by prepending or appending a '1'
to the shape, the operation is performed, and then the added
dimension is removed from the output.  The 1 is always added on the
"outside" of the shape: prepended for left arguments, and appended
for right arguments.  The result is that matrix @ vector and vector
@ matrix are both legal (assuming compatible shapes), and both
return 1d vectors; vector @ vector returns a scalar.  This is
clearer with examples.

scalar value, not in matrix form.  So this is the standard inner
product on vectors.

       An infelicity of this definition for 1d vectors is that it makes
       <tt class="docutils literal">

       </tt>
       ).  But this seems to be a case where
practicality beats purity: non-associativity only arises for strange
expressions that would never be written in practice; if they are
written anyway then there is a consistent rule for understanding
what will happen (
       <tt class="docutils literal">
        Mat1 @ vec @ Mat2

       is parsed as

       <tt class="docutils literal">

would rule out many important use cases that do arise very commonly

       For inputs with more than 2 dimensions, we treat the last two
dimensions as being the dimensions of the matrices to multiply, and
'broadcast' across the other dimensions.  This provides a convenient
way to quickly compute many matrix products in a single operation.
For example,
       <tt class="docutils literal">
        arr(10, 2, 3) @ arr(10, 3, 4)
       </tt>
       performs 10 separate
matrix multiplies, each of which multiplies a 2x3 and a 3x4 matrix
to produce a 2x4 matrix, and then returns the 10 resulting matrices
together in an array with shape (10, 2, 4).  The intuition here is
that we treat these 3d arrays of numbers as if they were 1d arrays
       <em>
        of matrices
       </em>
       , and then apply matrix multiplication in an
elementwise manner, where now each 'element' is a whole matrix.
Note that broadcasting is not limited to perfectly aligned arrays;
in more complicated cases, it allows several simple but powerful
tricks for controlling how arrays are aligned with each other; see
       <a class="footnote-reference" href="#broadcasting" id="id8">
        [10]
       </a>
       for details.  (In particular, it turns out that
when broadcasting is taken into account, the standard scalar *
matrix product is a special case of the elementwise multiplication
operator
       <tt class="docutils literal">
        *
       </tt>
       .)
      </p>
      <p>
       If one operand is &gt;2d, and another operand is 1d, then the above
rules apply unchanged, with 1d-&gt;2d promotion performed before
broadcasting.  E.g.,
       <tt class="docutils literal">
        arr(10, 2, 3) @ arr(3)
       </tt>
       first promotes to
       <tt class="docutils literal">
        arr(10, 2, 3) @ arr(3, 1)
       </tt>
       , then broadcasts the right argument to
create the aligned operation
       <tt class="docutils literal">
        arr(10, 2, 3) @ arr(10, 3, 1)
       </tt>
       ,
multiplies to get an array with shape (10, 2, 1), and finally
removes the added dimension, returning an array with shape (10, 2).
Similarly,
       <tt class="docutils literal">
        arr(2) @ arr(10, 2, 3)
       </tt>
       produces an intermediate array
with shape (10, 1, 3), and a final array with shape (10, 3).
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p class="first">
       0d (scalar) inputs raise an error.  Scalar * matrix multiplication

      Projects which currently use * for matrix multiplication, and which

     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     There are several projects which implement matrix types, but from a
very different perspective than the numerical libraries discussed
above.  These projects focus on computational methods for analyzing
matrices in the sense of abstract mathematical objects (i.e., linear
maps over free modules over rings), rather than as big bags full of
numbers that need crunching.  And it turns out that from the abstract
math point of view, there isn't much use for elementwise operations in
the first place; as discussed in the Background section above,
elementwise operations are motivated by the bag-of-numbers approach.
So these projects don't encounter the basic problem that this PEP
exists to address, making it mostly irrelevant to them; while they
appear superficially similar to projects like numpy, they're actually
doing something quite different.  They use
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      *
     </tt>
     for matrix
multiplication (and for group actions, and so forth), and if this PEP
is accepted, their expressed intention is to continue doing so, while
perhaps adding
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     as an alias.  These projects include:

     Restricting ourselves only to symbols present on US English keyboards,
the punctuation characters that don't already have a meaning in Python
expression context are:
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     , backtick,
     <tt class="docutils literal">

     , and
     <tt class="docutils literal">

     </tt>
     .  Of
these options,
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     is clearly the best;
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      !
     </tt>
     and
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      ?
     </tt>
     are already
heavily freighted with inapplicable meanings in the programming
context, backtick has been banned from Python by BDFL pronouncement
(see
     <a class="reference external" href="../pep-3099/index.html">
      PEP 3099
     </a>
     ), and
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      $
     </tt>
     is uglier, even more dissimilar to
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      *
     </tt>
     and
     <span class="formula">
      ⋅
     </span>
     , and has Perl/PHP baggage.
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      $
     </tt>
     is probably the
second-best option of these, though.
    </p>
    <p>
     Symbols which are not present on US English keyboards start at a
significant disadvantage (having to spend 5 minutes at the beginning
of every numeric Python tutorial just going over keyboard layouts is
not a hassle anyone really wants).  Plus, even if we somehow overcame
the typing problem, it's not clear there are any that are actually
better than
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     .  Some options that have been suggested include:
    </p>
    <ul class="simple">
     <li>
      U+00D7 MULTIPLICATION SIGN:
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       A × B
      </tt>
     </li>
     <li>
      U+22C5 DOT OPERATOR:
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       A ⋅ B
      </tt>
     </li>
     <li>
      U+2297 CIRCLED TIMES:
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       A ⊗ B
      </tt>
     </li>
     <li>
      U+00B0 DEGREE:
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       A ° B
      </tt>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     What we need, though, is an operator that means "matrix
multiplication, as opposed to scalar/elementwise multiplication".
There is no conventional symbol with this meaning in either
programming or mathematics, where these operations are usually
distinguished by context.  (And U+2297 CIRCLED TIMES is actually used
conventionally to mean exactly the wrong things: elementwise
multiplication -- the "Hadamard product" -- or outer product, rather
than matrix/inner product like our operator).
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     at least has the
virtue that it
     <em>
      looks
     </em>
     like a funny non-commutative operator; a naive
user who knows maths but not programming couldn't look at
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      A * B
     </tt>
     versus
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      A × B
     </tt>
     , or
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      A * B
     </tt>
     versus
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      A ⋅ B
     </tt>
     , or
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      A * B
     </tt>
     versus
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      A ° B
     </tt>
     and guess which one is the usual multiplication, and which
one is the special case.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, there is the option of using multi-character tokens.  Some
options:
    </p>
    <ul class="simple">
     <li>
      Matlab and Julia use a
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       .*
      </tt>
      operator.  Aside from being visually
confusable with
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       *
      </tt>
      , this would be a terrible choice for us
because in Matlab and Julia,
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       *
      </tt>
      means matrix multiplication and
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       .*
      </tt>
      means elementwise multiplication, so using
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       .*
      </tt>
      for matrix
multiplication would make us exactly backwards from what Matlab and
Julia users expect.
     </li>
     <li>
      APL apparently used
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       +.×
      </tt>
      , which by combining a multi-character
token, confusing attribute-access-like . syntax, and a unicode
character, ranks somewhere below U+2603 SNOWMAN on our candidate
list.  If we like the idea of combining addition and multiplication
operators as being evocative of how matrix multiplication actually
works, then something like
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       +*
      </tt>
      could be used -- though this may
be too easy to confuse with
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       *+
      </tt>
      , which is just multiplication
combined with the unary
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       +
      </tt>
      operator.
     </li>
     <li>
      <a class="reference external" href="../pep-0211/index.html">
       PEP 211
      </a>
      suggested
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       ~*
      </tt>
      .  This has the downside that it sort of
suggests that there is a unary
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       *
      </tt>
      operator that is being combined
with unary
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       ~
      </tt>
      , but it could work.
     </li>
     <li>
      R uses
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       %*%
      </tt>
      for matrix multiplication.  In R this forms part of a
general extensible infix system in which all tokens of the form
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       %foo%
      </tt>
      are user-defined binary operators.  We could steal the
token without stealing the system.
     </li>
     <li>
      Some other plausible candidates that have been suggested:
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       &gt;&lt;
      </tt>
      (=
ascii drawing of the multiplication sign ×); the footnote operator
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       [*]
      </tt>
      or
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       |*|
      </tt>
      (but when used in context, the use of vertical
grouping symbols tends to recreate the nested parentheses visual
clutter that was noted as one of the major downsides of the function
syntax we're trying to get away from);
      <tt class="docutils literal">
       ^*
      </tt>
      .
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     So, it doesn't matter much, but
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     seems as good or better than any
of the alternatives:
    </p>
    <ul class="simple">
     <li>
      It's a friendly character that Pythoneers are already used to typing
in decorators, but the decorator usage and the math expression
usage are sufficiently dissimilar that it would be hard to confuse
them in practice.
     </li>

      It's widely accessible across keyboard layouts (and thanks to its

     <a class="toc-backref" href="#id40">
      Precedence and associativity
     </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
     There was a long discussion
     <a class="footnote-reference" href="#associativity-discussions" id="id10">
      [15]
     </a>
     about
whether
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     should be right- or left-associative (or even something
more exotic
     <a class="footnote-reference" href="#group-associativity" id="id11">
      [18]
     </a>
     ). Almost all Python operators are
left-associative, so following this convention would be the simplest
approach, but there were two arguments that suggested matrix
multiplication might be worth making right-associative as a special
case:
    </p>
    <p>
     First, matrix multiplication has a tight conceptual association with
function application/composition, so many mathematically sophisticated
users have an intuition that an expression like
     <span class="formula">
      <i>
       R
      </i>
      <i>
       S
      </i>
      <i>
       x
      </i>
     </span>
     proceeds
from right-to-left, with first
     <span class="formula">
      <i>
       S
      </i>
     </span>
     transforming the vector
     <span class="formula">
      <i>
       x
      </i>
     </span>
     , and then
     <span class="formula">
      <i>
       R
      </i>
     </span>
     transforming the result. This isn't
universally agreed (and not all number-crunchers are steeped in the
pure-math conceptual framework that motivates this intuition
     <a class="footnote-reference" href="#oil-industry-versus-right-associativity" id="id12">
      [16]
     </a>
     ), but at the least this
intuition is more common than for other operations like
     <span class="formula">
      2⋅3⋅4
     </span>
     which everyone reads as going from left-to-right.
    </p>
    <p>
     Second, if expressions like
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      Mat @ Mat @ vec
     </tt>
     appear often in code,
then programs will run faster (and efficiency-minded programmers will
be able to use fewer parentheses) if this is evaluated as
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      Mat @ (Mat
@ vec)
     </tt>
     then if it is evaluated like
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      (Mat @ Mat) @ vec
     </tt>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     However, weighing against these arguments are the following:
    </p>
    <p>
     Regarding the efficiency argument, empirically, we were unable to find
any evidence that
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      Mat @ Mat @ vec
     </tt>
     type expressions actually
dominate in real-life code. Parsing a number of large projects that
use numpy, we found that when forced by numpy's current funcall syntax
to choose an order of operations for nested calls to
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      dot
     </tt>
     , people
actually use left-associative nesting slightly
     <em>
      more
     </em>
     often than
right-associative nesting
     <a class="footnote-reference" href="#numpy-associativity-counts" id="id13">
      [17]
     </a>
     .  And anyway,
writing parentheses isn't so bad -- if an efficiency-minded programmer
is going to take the trouble to think through the best way to evaluate
some expression, they probably
     <em>
      should
     </em>
     write down the parentheses
regardless of whether they're needed, just to make it obvious to the
next reader that they order of operations matter.
    </p>
    <p>
     In addition, it turns out that other languages, including those with
much more of a focus on linear algebra, overwhelmingly make their
matmul operators left-associative. Specifically, the
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     equivalent
is left-associative in R, Matlab, Julia, IDL, and Gauss. The only
exceptions we found are Mathematica, in which
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      a @ b @ c
     </tt>
     would be
parsed non-associatively as
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      dot(a, b, c)
     </tt>
     , and APL, in which all
operators are right-associative. There do not seem to exist any
languages that make
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     right-associative and
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      *
     </tt>
     left-associative. And these decisions don't seem to be controversial
-- I've never seen anyone complaining about this particular aspect of
any of these other languages, and the left-associativity of
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      *
     </tt>
     doesn't seem to bother users of the existing Python libraries that use
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      *
     </tt>
     for matrix multiplication. So, at the least we can conclude from
this that making
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     left-associative will certainly not cause any
disasters. Making
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     right-associative, OTOH, would be exploring
new and uncertain ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     And another advantage of left-associativity is that it is much easier
to learn and remember that
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     acts like
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      *
     </tt>
     , than it is to
remember first that
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     is unlike other Python operators by being
right-associative, and then on top of this, also have to remember
whether it is more tightly or more loosely binding than
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      *
     </tt>
     . (Right-associativity forces us to choose a precedence, and
intuitions were about equally split on which precedence made more
sense. So this suggests that no matter which choice we made, no-one

     On net, therefore, the general consensus of the numerical community is
that while matrix multiplication is something of a special case, it's
not special enough to break the rules, and
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      @
     </tt>
     should parse like
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      *

     does.

semantics for

     <tt class="docutils literal">

     objects, for several reasons.  Of
course this could be added if someone wants it, but these types would
require quite a bit of additional work beyond
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      __matmul__
     </tt>
     before
they could be used for numeric work -- e.g., they have no way to do
addition or scalar multiplication either! -- and adding such
functionality is beyond the scope of this PEP.  In addition, providing
a quality implementation of matrix multiplication is highly
non-trivial.  Naive nested loop implementations are very slow and
shipping such an implementation in CPython would just create a trap
for users.  But the alternative -- providing a modern, competitive
matrix multiply -- would require that CPython link to a BLAS library,
which brings a set of new complications.  In particular, several
popular BLAS libraries (including the one that ships by default on
OS X) currently break the use of
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      multiprocessing
     </tt>
     <a class="footnote-reference" href="#blas-fork" id="id14">
      [8]

     .
Together, these considerations mean that the cost/benefit of adding
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      __matmul__
     </tt>
     to these types just isn't there, so for now we'll
continue to delegate these problems to numpy and friends, and defer a
more systematic solution to a future proposal.

     Rejected alternatives to adding a new operator
    </a>
   </h1>
   <p>
    Over the past few decades, the Python numeric community has explored a
variety of ways to resolve the tension between matrix and elementwise
multiplication operations.
    <a class="reference external" href="../pep-0211/index.html">
     PEP 211
    </a>
    and
    <a class="reference external" href="../pep-0225/index.html">
     PEP 225
    </a>
    , both proposed in 2000
and last seriously discussed in 2008
    <a class="footnote-reference" href="#threads-2008" id="id16">
     [9]
    </a>
    , were early
attempts to add new operators to solve this problem, but suffered from
serious flaws; in particular, at that time the Python numerical
community had not yet reached consensus on the proper API for array
objects, or on what operators might be needed or useful (e.g.,
    <a class="reference external" href="../pep-0225/index.html">
     PEP 225
    </a>
    proposes 6 new operators with unspecified semantics).  Experience
since then has now led to consensus that the best solution, for both
numeric Python and core Python, is to add a single infix operator for
matrix multiply (together with the other new operators this implies
like
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     @=
    </tt>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    We review some of the rejected alternatives here.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Use a second type that defines __mul__ as matrix multiplication:
    </strong>
    As discussed above (
    <a class="reference internal" href="#background-what-s-wrong-with-the-status-quo">
     Background: What's wrong with the status quo?
    </a>
    ),
this has been tried this for many years via the
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     numpy.matrix
    </tt>
    type
(and its predecessors in Numeric and numarray).  The result is a
strong consensus among both numpy developers and developers of
downstream packages that
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     numpy.matrix
    </tt>
    should essentially never be
used, because of the problems caused by having conflicting duck types
for arrays.  (Of course one could then argue we should
    <em>
     only
    </em>
    define
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     __mul__
    </tt>
    to be matrix multiplication, but then we'd have the same
problem with elementwise multiplication.)  There have been several
pushes to remove
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     numpy.matrix
    </tt>
    entirely; the only counter-arguments
have come from educators who find that its problems are outweighed by
the need to provide a simple and clear mapping between mathematical
notation and code for novices (see
    <a class="reference internal" href="#transparent-syntax-is-especially-crucial-for-non-expert-programmers">
     Transparent syntax is especially
crucial for non-expert programmers
    </a>
    ).  But, of course, starting out
newbies with a dispreferred syntax and then expecting them to
transition later causes its own problems.  The two-type solution is
worse than the disease.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Add lots of new operators, or add a new generic syntax for defining
infix operators:
    </strong>
    In addition to being generally un-Pythonic and
repeatedly rejected by BDFL fiat, this would be using a sledgehammer
to smash a fly.  The scientific python community has consensus that
adding one operator for matrix multiplication is enough to fix the one
otherwise unfixable pain point. (In retrospect, we all think
    <a class="reference external" href="../pep-0225/index.html">
     PEP 225
    </a>
    was a bad idea too -- or at least far more complex than it needed to
be.)
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Add a new @ (or whatever) operator that has some other meaning in
general Python, and then overload it in numeric code:
    </strong>
    This was the
approach taken by
    <a class="reference external" href="../pep-0211/index.html">
     PEP 211
    </a>
    , which proposed defining
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     @
    </tt>
    to be the
equivalent of
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     itertools.product
    </tt>
    .  The problem with this is that
when taken on its own terms, it's pretty clear that
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     itertools.product
    </tt>
    doesn't actually need a dedicated operator.  It
hasn't even been deemed worth of a builtin.  (During discussions of
this PEP, a similar suggestion was made to define
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     @
    </tt>
    as a general
purpose function composition operator, and this suffers from the same
problem;
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     functools.compose
    </tt>
    isn't even useful enough to exist.)
Matrix multiplication has a uniquely strong rationale for inclusion as
an infix operator.  There almost certainly don't exist any other
binary operations that will ever justify adding any other infix
operators to Python.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Add a .dot method to array types so as to allow "pseudo-infix"
A.dot(B) syntax:
    </strong>
    This has been in numpy for some years, and in many
cases it's better than dot(A, B).  But it's still much less readable
than real infix notation, and in particular still suffers from an
extreme overabundance of parentheses.  See
    <a class="reference internal" href="#why-should-matrix-multiplication-be-infix">
     Why should matrix
multiplication be infix?
    </a>
    above.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Use a 'with' block to toggle the meaning of * within a single code
block
    </strong>
    : E.g., numpy could define a special context object so that
we'd have:
   </p>
   <pre class="literal-block">
c = a * b   # element-wise multiplication
with numpy.mul_as_dot:
    c = a * b  # matrix multiplication
</pre>
   <p>
    However, this has two serious problems: first, it requires that every
array-like type's
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     __mul__
    </tt>
    method know how to check some global
state (
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     numpy.mul_is_currently_dot
    </tt>
    or whatever).  This is fine if
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     a
    </tt>
    and
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     b
    </tt>
    are numpy objects, but the world contains many
non-numpy array-like objects.  So this either requires non-local
coupling -- every numpy competitor library has to import numpy and
then check
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     numpy.mul_is_currently_dot
    </tt>
    on every operation -- or
else it breaks duck-typing, with the above code doing radically
different things depending on whether
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     a
    </tt>
    and
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     b
    </tt>
    are numpy
objects or some other sort of object.  Second, and worse,
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     with
    </tt>
    blocks are dynamically scoped, not lexically scoped; i.e., any
function that gets called inside the
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     with
    </tt>
    block will suddenly find
itself executing inside the mul_as_dot world, and crash and burn
horribly -- if you're lucky.  So this is a construct that could only
be used safely in rather limited cases (no function calls), and which
would make it very easy to shoot yourself in the foot without warning.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Use a language preprocessor that adds extra numerically-oriented
operators and perhaps other syntax:
    </strong>
    (As per recent BDFL suggestion:
    <a class="footnote-reference" href="#preprocessor" id="id17">
     [1]
    </a>
    ) This suggestion seems based on the idea that
numerical code needs a wide variety of syntax additions.  In fact,
given
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     @
    </tt>
    , most numerical users don't need any other operators or
syntax; it solves the one really painful problem that cannot be solved
by other means, and that causes painful reverberations through the
larger ecosystem.  Defining a new language (presumably with its own
parser which would have to be kept in sync with Python's, etc.), just
to support a single binary operator, is neither practical nor
desireable.  In the numerical context, Python's competition is
special-purpose numerical languages (Matlab, R, IDL, etc.).  Compared
to these, Python's killer feature is exactly that one can mix
specialized numerical code with code for XML parsing, web page
generation, database access, network programming, GUI libraries, and
so forth, and we also gain major benefits from the huge variety of
tutorials, reference material, introductory classes, etc., which use
Python.  Fragmenting "numerical Python" from "real Python" would be a
major source of confusion.  A major motivation for this PEP is to
    <em>
     reduce
    </em>
    fragmentation.  Having to set up a preprocessor would be an
especially prohibitive complication for unsophisticated users.  And we
use Python because we like Python!  We don't want
almost-but-not-quite-Python.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Use overloading hacks to define a "new infix operator" like *dot*,
as in a well-known Python recipe:
    </strong>
    (See:
    <a class="footnote-reference" href="#infix-hack" id="id18">
     [2]
    </a>
    ) Beautiful is
better than ugly.  This is... not beautiful.  And not Pythonic.  And
especially unfriendly to beginners, who are just trying to wrap their
heads around the idea that there's a coherent underlying system behind
these magic incantations that they're learning, when along comes an
evil hack like this that violates that system, creates bizarre error
messages when accidentally misused, and whose underlying mechanisms
can't be understood without deep knowledge of how object oriented
systems work.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Use a special "facade" type to support syntax like arr.M * arr:
    </strong>
    This is very similar to the previous proposal, in that the
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     .M
    </tt>
    attribute would basically return the same object as
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     arr *dot` would,
and thus suffers the same objections about 'magicalness'.  This
approach also has some
     <span class="pre">
      non-obvious
     </span>
     complexities: for example, while
``arr.M * arr
    </tt>
    must return an array,
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     arr.M * arr.M
    </tt>
    and
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     arr *
arr.M
    </tt>
    must return facade objects, or else
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     arr.M * arr.M * arr
    </tt>
    and
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     arr * arr.M * arr
    </tt>
    will not work.  But this means that facade
objects must be able to recognize both other array objects and other
facade objects (which creates additional complexity for writing
interoperating array types from different libraries who must now
recognize both each other's array types and their facade types).  It
also creates pitfalls for users who may easily type
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     arr * arr.M
    </tt>
    or
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     arr.M * arr.M
    </tt>
    and expect to get back an array object; instead,
they will get a mysterious object that throws errors when they attempt
to use it.  Basically with this approach users must be careful to
think of
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     .M*
    </tt>
    as an indivisible unit that acts as an infix operator
-- and as infix-operator-like token strings go, at least
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     *dot*
    </tt>
    is prettier looking (look at its cute little ears!).

        <li>
         Bayesian statistics made simple
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        In addition, the following tutorials could easily involve matrices:
       </p>
       <ul class="simple">
        <li>
         Introduction to game programming
        </li>

         mrjob: Snakes on a Hadoop
         <em>
          ("We'll introduce some data science
concepts, such as user-user similarity, and show how to calculate
these metrics...")

       </ul>
       <p class="last">
        This gives an estimated range of 8 to 12 / 36 = 22% to 33% of
tutorials dealing with matrices; saying ~20% then gives us some
wiggle room in case our estimates are high.

        on 2014-04-10 at ~21:00 UTC.  The reported values are the numbers
given in the "Languages" box on the lower-left corner, next to
"Python".  This also causes some undercounting (e.g., leaving out
Cython code, and possibly one should also count HTML docs and so
forth), but these effects are negligible (e.g., only ~1% of numpy
usage appears to occur in Cython code, and probably even less for
the other modules listed).  The use of this box is crucial,
however, because these counts appear to be stable, while the
"overall" counts listed at the top of the page ("We've found ___
code results") are highly variable even for a single search --
simply reloading the page can cause this number to vary by a factor
of 2 (!!).  (They do seem to settle down if one reloads the page
repeatedly, but nonetheless this is spooky enough that it seemed
better to avoid these numbers.)
       </p>
       <p>
        These numbers should of course be taken with multiple grains of
salt; it's not clear how representative Github is of Python code in
general, and limitations of the search tool make it impossible to
get precise counts.  AFAIK this is the best data set currently
available, but it'd be nice if it were better.  In particular:
       </p>
       <ul class="simple">
        <li>
         Lines like
         <tt class="docutils literal">
          import sys, os
         </tt>
         will only be counted in the
         <tt class="docutils literal">
          sys
         </tt>
         row.
        </li>
        <li>
         A file containing both
         <tt class="docutils literal">
          import X
         </tt>
         and
         <tt class="docutils literal">
          from X import
         </tt>
         will be
counted twice
        </li>
        <li>
         Imports of the form
         <tt class="docutils literal">
          from X.foo import ...
         </tt>
         are missed.  We
could catch these by instead searching for "from X", but this is
a common phrase in English prose, so we'd end up with false
positives from comments, strings, etc.  For many of the modules
considered this shouldn't matter too much -- for example, the
stdlib modules have flat namespaces -- but it might especially
lead to undercounting of django, scipy, and twisted.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Also, it's possible there exist other non-stdlib modules we didn't
think to test that are even more-imported than numpy -- though we
tried quite a few of the obvious suspects.  If you find one, let us
know!  The modules tested here were chosen based on a combination
of intuition and the top-100 list at pypi-ranking.info.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fortunately, it doesn't really matter if it turns out that numpy
is, say, merely the
        <em>
         third
        </em>
        most-imported non-stdlib module, since
the point is just that numeric programming is a common and
mainstream activity.
       </p>
       <p class="last">
        Finally, we should point out the obvious: whether a package is
import**ed** is rather different from whether it's import**ant**.
No-one's claiming numpy is "the most important package" or anything
like that.  Certainly more packages depend on distutils, e.g., then
depend on numpy -- and far fewer source files import distutils than
import numpy.  But this is fine for our present purposes.  Most
source files don't import distutils because most source files don't
care how they're distributed, so long as they are; these source
files thus don't care about details of how distutils' API works.
This PEP is in some sense about changing how numpy's and related
packages' APIs work, so the relevant metric is to look at source
files that are choosing to directly interact with that API, which
is sort of like what we get by looking at import statements.
